# Image-Restoration_and_Enhancement_using_PDE-Models

1. Designed and analysed Total Variation Equation, Geometric Heat Equation and Linear Heat Equation PDE models for noise removal and restoration of distorted images and videos using Python and MATLAB. 

2. Total Variation PDE models show 31% and 99% improvement over the other models respectively, measure based on the SNR and MSE ratios.
